# grafana-typescript-plugin
Starter project to make it easier to develop Grafana plugins with TypeScript and VSCode.

This project brings together the basic scaffolding require to work with Grafana in TypeScript using Visual Studio Code. It contains the following basic pieces:

* A suitable tsconfig.json file configured to use the ES System module loader.
* A simple gulpfile.js that provides some basic utilities for development automation.
* Extracted (un-entangled) d.ts files for Grafana
